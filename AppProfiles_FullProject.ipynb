We want to make sure that we are analyzing the right information, otherwise our analysis will be useless and ineffective to the task at hand.

    "When we visualize the apps that are making up most of the reviews we find that Waze and Google Maps have the majority of the user reviews. Seeing that two apps are dominating this entire genre and the next popular app only has 12,811 reviews, we have to ask ourselves do we really want to spend our time competing with these two giants. Is there anything different we can create that will persuade the user to use our app rather than these two popular ones? The goal of our company is to increase the number of users that utilize our apps, but unless we have an idea that will disrupt the GPS market, creating a navigation app right now seems like a roll of the dice and it would most likely be a miss than a hit because of how heavily people depend on Waze and Google Maps. \n",

    "Both the App Store and Google Play markets are vast and since their conception, apps have been continuously showing up on both these markets by the minute. It can get very challenging to create something that stands out from the rest and eventually brings in a revenue stream. In this project, we concluded from our analysis that if we wanted to create a profitable app profile, we should look into designing an app that digitizes a book and adds features that are unique to the app, perhaps a medical dictionary. At this stage, our analysis really just touched the tip of the surface. Our goal was to use Python and pinpoint the type of apps that would create a profit for our company. We could actually dive deeper and explore other genres to see if we can find other potential profiles that pique our interests, but we will leave this for a future project.   "
