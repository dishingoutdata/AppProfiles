## Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets

For this entry level project, we'll pretend we're working as data analysts for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps. Our company creates apps that are available on both Google Play and the App Store. We only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. Therefore, our revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users who use our app. Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users. The analysis will be done using Python.
